# ChangeCalculator

Implementing ChangeCalculator using .NET Core console application


Pre-requisites
.Net core 3.1 SDK Visual studio 2019 OR VSCode with C# extension

Installation
Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/haidery786/ChangeCalculator

Restore packages: dotnet restore ChangeCalculator.sln

Run the ChangeCalculator project, it will ask to enter the product price and then the amount. Finally it will print the change.
I just covered the GBP currency, but other currencies can be done in the same way. I have not put any validation as it was just a demo.
I have also created a Test project with one test. More tests can be written.
